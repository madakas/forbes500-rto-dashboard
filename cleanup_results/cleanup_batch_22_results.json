Employee reviews from 2024 are highly critical of this policy, noting it contradicts marketed work-life balance claims. A significant complaint involves calculation issues where holidays and PTO aren't factored properly, forcing employees to work 5 days/week to meet the 80% threshold. This represents a tightening from previous more flexible arrangements. The policy has been described as 'forced back into the office with little to no flexibility' in multiple 2024 reviews.",

The majority of roles have adopted hybrid schedules with substantial remote work. Some departments offer specific allocations (e.g., 24 WFH days/year = ~2 days/month), while other positions are fully remote. Job postings show many 100% remote positions available.
