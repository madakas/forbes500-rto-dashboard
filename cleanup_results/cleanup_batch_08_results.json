    "rto_policy": "Full RTO (5 days)",
    "policy_details": "Broadcom CEO Hock Tan mandated a strict return-to-office policy requiring employees living within 50 miles of an office to work in-person five days per week. Following the $69 billion acquisition of VMware in late 2023, the policy was enforced starting December 4, 2023. CEO stated 'Any other exception, you better learn how to walk on water' indicating virtually no flexibility. This represents one of the strictest RTO mandates among major tech companies, with no hybrid or remote options for employees within the 50-mile radius.",

    "policy_details": "Dominion Energy has adopted a hybrid work schedule where most employees work in the office three days per week and work remotely two days per week (3-2 hybrid model). With 65% of its workforce going into the field daily, full remote work is not feasible company-wide. The policy varies by role and location - some sites have hybrid arrangements, some are fully remote, and some require in-person only. The company is adjusting its real estate footprint to accommodate the hybrid model, including selling its 20-story high rise building in downtown Richmond as they transition to this flexible workforce model.",
