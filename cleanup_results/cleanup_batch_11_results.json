The company recommends 2-3 days per week hybrid work but leaves final decisions to individual teams. Employees must be designated to SF, NY, or Seattle locations, but enforcement depends on team requirements. This represents a notably employee-friendly approach compared to stricter RTO mandates at other tech companies."
