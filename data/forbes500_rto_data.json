In August 2024, Foot Locker announced plans to relocate global headquarters to St. Petersburg, FL in 2025 with no forced employee relocation (175 new FL jobs, 330 total in St. Pete). However, following $2.4B acquisition by Dick's Sporting Goods (Pittsburgh-based) in September 2024, the FL headquarters move was canceled in November 2025. Current policy maintains 3-day hybrid for corporate (NYC HQ), with some remote positions available. Retail operations remain on-site.",
