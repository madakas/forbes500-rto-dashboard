CEO David Cordani's announcement required the majority of work time in office with flexibility for balance. The shift affected 90% of employees who had been working remotely. Some employees reported being required to drive 1-2 hours, three times per week, even those hired as 100% remote or who had worked remotely for 15+ years. Employee reports suggest strict enforcement with termination for non-compliance. There is speculation about potential future tightening to 5 days/week by 2025, though this remains unconfirmed. The company frames the policy around 'Purposeful Presence' strategy."

The hospital has expanded virtual care offerings including the Cardiac LIFT Clinic, the first completely virtual care program for single-ventricle patients."

As a manufacturing company with hardware production, some roles necessarily require on-site presence while the company explicitly offers remote/hybrid options for eligible positions. Limited public information suggests a flexible, role-based approach typical of technology companies."
