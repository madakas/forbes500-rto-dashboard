Remote workers must have internet meeting minimum speed requirements (25 Mbps download, 10 Mbps upload). The company designs offices primarily for strategic meetings rather than daily work.

Some employees reported being required to drive 1-2 hours, three times per week, even those hired as 100% remote or who had worked remotely for 15+ years. Employee reports suggest strict enforcement with termination for non-compliance. There is speculation about potential future tightening to 5 days/week by 2025, though this remains unconfirmed.
